inSync by OmniFlix (for Communities)
===

inSync is a collaborative interface for an entire community (or) blockchain network to:
- identify stakeholders such as validator node hosts (will expand to other types of node hosts depending on the network)
- discover proposals
& more!

Currently, the aim of inSync is to be the default/defacto interface when bootstrapping community activities of a specific chain (on testnet or mainnet).
